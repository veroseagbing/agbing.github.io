            <h1>Change Log</h1>
            <h3>03 November 2025</h3>
            <p>Many many many updates, too many to list, it's practically building the framework for all of it. Added sections and pages for the three sections of the website. Added this change log. Hoping to add fun things like blinkies and personal writing.</p>
