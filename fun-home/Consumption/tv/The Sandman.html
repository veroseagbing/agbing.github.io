                My first review! So I don't know how to write one at all. But here is my best effort.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Sandman was a beautiful story about love and change. Which seems really basic, but their elements of storytelling was just absolutely spectacular. It brought tears, I was shocked, and I sat at the edge of my seat the whole time. I definitely think that there was much more of a character arc for the second season, which makes sense since they went through more of the novels (I think). I would have been fine with the slower pacing of the first season for sure, but because of Neil Gaiman and his sins I'm also glad they stopped the show.

                Little thing I loved was the portrayal of Lucifer. I was obsessed! The delicate features of this actor was such a contrast to the world and costuming of Lucifer. My little theater heart was yelling!!!

                The characters were well-developed in the second season. I understand the lack of characters, especially the other Endless, in the first season. Even with the second season's blast through the storyline, I felt like I connected with the characters, understood their compelling motivations, and appreciated their complexity. It's smart, the way the Endless are portrayed sometimes, clever in a way that I appreciate the nuance in their character.
